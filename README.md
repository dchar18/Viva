## References

(1) Much of the Firebase code is referenced from Sanskar Tiwari's YouTube Channel (link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTju8w4zEno&list=PLBxWkM8PLHcr2vkdY2n9rIcxjZ9Th3Us7). I try to document where I used his code throughout my project files with a "Reference 1" to acknowledge that the code was not written by me. As I become more familiar with Flutter and Firebase, I hope to substitute his code for my own code.
